- For mobile there will be one column for showing mission data.
- For tablet there will be two columns for showing mission data.
- For desktop width is breaking down to 4 columns with 25% with the help of flex.
- For larger mission title 3 dots append at the end of some mission name after some length with the help of javascript sting function, so that tiles will look unique and not distorted.
